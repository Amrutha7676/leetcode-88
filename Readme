🧩 Problem Statement
Given two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2, merge nums2 into nums1 as one sorted array.
nums1 has a length of m + n, where:
First m elements are valid
Last n elements are 0 (placeholders)
nums2 has n elements
✅ Goal
Modify nums1 in-place so that it contains the merged sorted array.
💡 Approach (Using Extra Array)
Create a temporary array mix of size m + n
Use two pointers:
i → traverse nums1
j → traverse nums2
Compare elements and store the smaller one in mix
Copy remaining elements (if any)
Copy mix back into nums1
  // 🔥 Copy back to num1
for (int x = 0; x < m + n; x++) {
    num1[x] = mix[x];
}
💡 Why this is needed

You created a new array mix and stored the merged result there.

But the problem requires modifying nums1 in-place.

So unless you copy mix → nums1, your answer is ignored.

🧠 Quick understanding

Think of it like:

mix = temporary answer

nums1 = final answer (must be updated)

⚠️ Important detail

You must copy all m + n elements, not just m.

✅ Your full logic now works perfectly

Merge into mix ✔️

Copy back to nums1 ✔️
